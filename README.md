7. **Check if a number is a palindrome**
   - A program to determine if a given number is a palindrome.
   
8. **Control flow with if-else statements**
   - A program that demonstrates the use of if-else statements in C.
   
9. **Control flow with if-else statements (greater than 5 and 10)**
   - A program that uses if-else statements to check if a number is greater than 5 and 10.
   
10. **Input and display array elements**
    - A program that takes input for an array and displays the elements.
    
11. **Calculate the sum of array elements**
    - A program that calculates the sum of all elements in an array.
    
12. **Find the largest element in an array**
    - A program that identifies the largest element from an array.
    
13. **Find the smallest element in an array**
    - A program that identifies the smallest element from an array.
    
14. **Print multiplication table**
    - A program that prints the multiplication table of a given number.
    
15. **Find factors of a number**
    - A program that finds all factors of a given number.
    
16. **Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers**
    - A program that computes the sum of the first n natural numbers.
    
17. **Check if a number is prime**
    - A program that checks whether a number is prime.
    
18. **Check even or odd using switch-case**
    - A program that checks if a number is even or odd using a switch-case statement.
    
19. **Check if a number is prime using a while loop**
    - A program that determines if a number is prime using a while loop.
    
20. **Find the greatest of three numbers**
    - A program that finds the greatest of three given numbers.

21. **Sum of digits of a number**
    - A program that calculates the sum of the digits of a given number.

22. **Fibonacci series**
    - A program that generates and displays the Fibonacci series up to a given number.

23. **Count vowels and consonants in a string**
    - A program that counts the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.

24. **Bubble sort algorithm**
    - A program that implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.

## Usage

Each program is a standalone C file. To compile and run any of these programs, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/classic-c-programs.git
   cd classic-c-programs

2. Compile the program (replace program_name.c with the actual file name):
   ```bash
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name

3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   ./program_name
